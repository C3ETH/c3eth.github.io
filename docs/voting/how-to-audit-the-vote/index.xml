The Catalyst team provides access to routine snapshots of the blockchain state. These snapshots are automatically taken at 1-hour intervals and uploaded to a persistent storage system in the form of an archive. Currently, these archives can be found by querying the Archive API . You can learn more about the available endpoints by inspecting the Swagger documentation</description></item><item><title>Audit the Snapshot</title><link>/docs/voting/how-to-audit-the-vote/audit-the-snapshot/</link><pubDate>Tue, 06 Oct 2020 08:48:23 +0000</pubDate><guid>/docs/voting/how-to-audit-the-vote/audit-the-snapshot/</guid><description>Parameters # Registration Deadline: Jan 15, 2024 21:45:00 UTC
Minimum Voting Power: 450 ADA.
Required Tools # dbSync # Installation instructions can be found here.
Ensure dbSync and the PostgreSQL database are running, and the database is synchronized past 21:45:00 UTC on the 20th of January 2024.
Note: IF your dbSync is not synchronized to at least this date, the results from running a snapshot will be inaccurate. This is because the snapshot is taken at a time when a rollback on the blockchain is impossible to affect the snapshot data, and therefore it&amp;rsquo;s fully reproducible and stable.</description></item><item><title>Audit The Tally</title><link>/docs/voting/how-to-audit-the-vote/audit-the-tally/</link><pubDate>Tue, 06 Oct 2020 08:48:23 +0000</pubDate><guid>/docs/voting/how-to-audit-the-vote/audit-the-tally/</guid><description>Follow the instructions in the video below to replay the vote and verify that the tally matches the official results:
