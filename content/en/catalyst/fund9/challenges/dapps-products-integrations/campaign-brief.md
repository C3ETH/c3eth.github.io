## Challenge Brief
Dapps, Products & Integrations is focused on the following areas:

Creation or improvement of different Dapps, products, and integrations that provide value to the Cardano community and wider ecosystem.Integrations with other existing services, products, and protocols that improve the end-user experience whether that's giving the user more options or making something easier to use that benefits the wider ecosystem. 

Cardano needs a thriving ecosystem of different Dapps, products and integrations for the community to use that increasingly become the better alternatives over current centralized providers. The more interesting and useful the products and integrations are that can be built in the ecosystem the more reasons people have to interact with the Cardano blockchain that can help further drive more adoption, feedback, growth and even more innovations.

### Types of proposals to include

- **DeFi** - Stable coins, DEXs, borrow & lending, synthetic assets, etc.
- **Marketplaces**
- **Gaming** - Open world games, card games, RPG, etc.
- **Transport & logistics**
- **Hardware** - Hardware wallets, Local ATMs for interacting with the blockchain, etc.
- **Physical products** - Tokenised housing as a Cardano native asset, International crypto headquarters and liason office on every continent, etc.
Social media
- **Nation governance systems** - New governance systems for nation-states
- **Environment** - Solutions that help to solve environmental issues
- **Many others** - Any other idea, product or integration that someone thinks should be built in the Cardano ecosystem!

### Potential success metrics for proposal types

- **DeFi** - Total value locked, the total number of users, number of active daily/weekly/monthly users
- **Marketplaces** - Total number of users, number of transactions performed
- **Gaming** - Number of players, player income generated (if play to earn), qualitative feedback on game experience, etc.
- **Transport & logistics** - Total number of packages tracked, Number of counterfeit items prevented
- **Hardware** - Number of items sold, number of total users, number of interactions with hardware solution
- **Physical products** - Number of products tokenised as a native asset, Number of people using physical solutions
- **Nation governance systems** - Amount of population onboarded, amount of costs saved due to new solution, security difficulty improvements over previous approach
- **Social media** - Total number of users, number of meaningful interactions
- **Environment** - Total number of users, total CO2 sequestered, amount of awareness being produced, number of people changing an environmentally damaging habit
- **Many others** - Proposers can add in whatever metrics or success criteria make sense for their own project!

**Considerations for proposers**

**Existing products or integrations** - What products or integrations already exist in the ecosystem? What are the core differences between the proposal being presented and those existing ones and why will that provide impact to the ecosystem?

**Technical requirements** - Does the Cardano ecosystem have the right tools, libraries and SDKs for the idea to be feasible? What needs to be introduced or improved for the proposal to fully reach its potential?

**Ecosystem maturity requirements** - Why is this product or integration suitable for execution right now? Are there enough pieces of infrastructure, applications or other integrations available that would be needed for this suggested proposal to have a strong chance of gaining adoption? For instance, if you were making a professional social network DApp, do the right identity tools and wallets exist to make a professional network feasible?

### Why is it important?
Quality Dapps, products and integrations will increase the utility & adoption of Cardano.

### What does success look like?
Novel and viable applications and products get built on top of Cardano attracting users. Integrations manage to pull in more adoption.
