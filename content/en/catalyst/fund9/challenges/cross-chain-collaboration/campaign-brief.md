## Challenge Brief
Why is this Challenge needed?

- Tribalism & maximalism are harmful.
- We are in the multi-chain future.
- Interoperability is the key.
- We need initiatives to increase communication, coordination and collaboration between chains.
- We have common challenges. Let’s solve those together.

### Common challenges for all blockchain communities
You could buddy up with someone from outside Cardano ecosystem and address one or more of these common challenges:

- Awareness & Understanding
- Organisation & Governance
- Culture, Diversity & Inclusion
- Innovation & Decision-making
- Collaboration Tools & Platforms
- Incentivized Participation
- Cost & Efficiency
- Regulation & Compliance
- Security & Privacy

### Examples of proposals you can submit to this challenge
This is an open-ended challenge that welcomes any proposal geared for cross-chain collaboration, co-innovation and interoperability. These can be any community-led projects, initiatives, solutions, tools or services. These could be, for instance:

- New technical implementations connecting Cardano to other blockchains and vice versa (SDKs, APIs, bridges etc)
- Governance ideas from other chains implemented as part of the Voltaire road map
- Already successful projects expanding from other chains to Cardano
- Expansion of Cardano-based projects into other chains
- Oracles and other tools to interpret and interact with cross-chain data
- Catalyst-created solutions adopted by other chains and communities
- Common research, education, outreach and innovation projects with other chains and communities (e.g. podcasts, hackathons, webinars, communication hubs, educational resources)

### Who to collaborate with?
Any chains and their communities are welcome but here are some ideas of where to prioritize:

- [Algorand](https://www.algorand.com/)
- [Avalanche](https://www.avax.network/)
- [Arweave](https://www.arweave.org/)
- [Casper](https://casper.network/en/network)
- [Celo](https://celo.org/)
- [Cosmos](https://cosmos.network/)
- [Elrond](https://elrond.com/)
- [Ethereum](https://ethereum.org/en/)
- [Fantom](https://fantom.foundation/)
- [Harmony](https://www.harmony.one/)
- [Holochain](https://www.holochain.org/)
- [ICON](https://iconrepublic.org/)
- [NEAR](https://near.org/)
- [Nervos](https://www.nervos.org/)
- [Polkadot](https://polkadot.network/)
- [Polygon](https://polygon.technology/)
- [Terra](https://www.terra.money/)
- [Zilliqa](https://www.zilliqa.com/)

### Why is it important?
We can be a catalyst for multi-chain awareness and interoperability of blockchains which guarantees shared success in the cryptoeconomy.

### What does Sucess look like?
Collaborative value creation between Project Catalyst and other communities, through both technical and non-technical initiatives alike.

### Key Metrics to measure
To evaluate the success of the challenge, we can track:

- On-chain activity growth due to new cross-chain implementations
- Number of proposals including participants from other blockchain communities
- Number of technical implementations connecting Cardano to other blockchains
- Ideas from other chains implemented by Catalyst
- Projects and dApps from other chains implemented on Cardano
- Catalyst-created solutions adopted by other chains/communities
- Number of events / workshops / sessions arranged with other communities
- Number of permanent initiatives with cross-chain teams (members from different blockchain communities together)
