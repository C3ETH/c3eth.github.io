## Challenge Brief
Funding Categories is an approach to doing funding categorisation that will welcome all ideas, maximize the amount of ideas submitted and reduce the effort for all stakeholders in the Catalyst process.

Funding categories also help remove the existing issues with challenge settings. They help to prevent duplicate challenge settings, remove challenges created by self interest, reduce the need for deep knowledge of the ecosystem from challenge proposal teams and also removes an easy entry point for malicious actors.

The full documentation for Catalyst Funding Categories can be found [here](https://catalyst-swarm.gitbook.io/catalyst-funding-categories/)

7 funding categories have been documented to cover all forms of ideas and proposals. All proposals can be found [here](https://linktr.ee/cardanopace)

The budget weighting for the 7 categories has been determined using a community governance process. The voting results for this process can be found [here](https://catalyst-swarm.gitbook.io/catalyst-funding-categories/community-votes/fund-8-categories-budget-weighting/voting-results-fund-8)

### Why is it important?
Cardano needs new innovations for the ecosystem to reach its potential and offer society alternatives to existing centralised systems

### What does success look like?
An increasing number of products or integrations that offer new solutions for people to interact with and benefit from whilst using Cardano

### Key Metrics to measure
- Increasing the number products available for the community to use that help to enrich the ecosystem with new use cases.
- Increase the number of integrations that bring existing solutions together for a more seamless and connected experience between different products.
- Increased quality of existing products & integrations through suggested improvements that is supported by customer feedback or increased usage by the community.

For individual success metrics for the different types of proposal that can be included please refer to the suggested challenge brief success metrics ideas.
