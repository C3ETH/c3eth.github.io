Fund Size: **2,500,000 USD paid in Ada**

## Campaign Brief
What applications will provide the most value for end users in 2022?

### Why is it important?
Quality Dapps and integrations will increase utility & adoption of Cardano. A broad funding challenge like this encourages more proposals.
### What does success look like?
Novel and viable applications get built of top of Cardano attracting users. Integrations manage to pull in more adoption.

### Key Metrics to Measure
To assess the challenge we will be asking ourselves: Did our efforts manage to attract users to the platform? Did our efforts result in new, viable applications built on top of Cardano?

Let an "application output" and an "application transaction" be an output and transactions that use the applications' script addresses, and an "application token" be a token that's issued by the application.

### Usage of applications developed during the challenge:
- Number/growth of application output
- Number/growth of application transactions
- The total volume of Ada involved in application transactions
- Total/growth of resource usage by applications
- Number/growth of distinct addresses mentioned in application transactions

### If the application uses tokens:
- Number/growth of application tokens
- Number/growth of distinct addresses holding application tokens
- Viability of applications developed during the challenge:
- How many of the applications are still being developed at the end of 2022?
- How many of the applications made a profit for their creators?
- How many of the teams which built the applications grew during 2022?
- How many of the teams which built the applications built (or plan to build) another application?

## Challenge Brief
The success of Bitcoin spawned numerous off-shoot experiments and the arrival of Ethereum increased tribalism. As the number of altcoins grew, unhealthy "maximalism" emerged. The future is multi-chain, however, and the cryptoeconomy thrives when interoperability and cross-chain collaboration are cherished and encouraged.

There are multiple next generation blockchains with cadres of zealous supporters, highly skilled developers and innovative technologies that Cardano and Project Catalyst can learn from. And, vice versa, we can help other networks thrive by offering the good practices developed in Catalyst. IOG has recently formed the UTXO alliance and started collaboration with numerous partners like COTI and SingularityNET. It's a good start but more is needed to address the lack of communication, coordination and collaboration between blockchain communities. Missing awareness of each other's doings forces us to duplicate our efforts. When we are separate we are not able to learn from each other's achievements or failures.

Cardano has a strong, open and inclusive community, let's make this a real super power and let's be the first ones to forge strong bonds. Let's create an enriching, open and safe environment, where people from different communities can find common ground and share knowledge, resources, skills, ideas and visions with one another. Let's go out there, break the silos and build bridges and presence between us.

### Guiding questions
- What are the key applications that underpin the application ecosystem on other platforms?
- What are the most profitable or most used applications on other ecosystems?
- What needs do users of Cardano have that could be solved by new applications?
- What applications deliver the highest amount of value with the least amount of technical sophistication?

### Potential directions
- Swaps, both simple and fancy variants (multi-party etc.)
- Escrow, both simple and fancy variants
- Integrations with existing products
- NFT marketplace or facilitator
- Solutions utilising the power of smart contracts
