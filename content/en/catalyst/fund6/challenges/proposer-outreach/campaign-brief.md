How can we encourage entrepreneurs from outside the Cardano ecosystem to submit proposals to Catalyst in the next two funds?

Fund Size: **$100,000 USD paid in Ada**

[Campaign page](https://cardano.ideascale.com/a/campaign-home/26105) and [browse ideas](https://cardano.ideascale.com/a/ideas/top/campaign-filter/byids/campaigns/26105/stage/unspecified).

## Campaign Brief

Outside proposers will inject vitality and diversity to the community while increasing the overall quality of proposals.

Cardano has ambitious plans to reach 1 billion people. To make this goal a reality, we must attract the brightest entrepreneurs from across the globe and encourage them to submit ideas which will have a positive impact on the ecosystem. The best ideas will be funded, providing entrepreneurs with a more democratized route to capital and ensuring that location is not a barrier to entry.

We must increase brand awareness of Catalyst amongst the entrepreneur community, via multi platform proposer outreach campaigns. From content creation to media coverage, hackathons and live events - we want the community to submit their ideas that will attract and engage this audience.

## How success looks like

Bright entrepreneurs, and specialized firms from across the globe learn about Catalyst and submit high impact proposals.

## Key metric to measure

To assess ROI of this challenge we will ask ourselves:

Did we get proposals from outside our ecosystem?

- Media coverage
- Ideas submitted from new members of the community.
- Community advisor rating of top 10% of "outsider" proposals
