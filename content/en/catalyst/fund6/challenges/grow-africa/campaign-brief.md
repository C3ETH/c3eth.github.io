How do we seed and grow Cardano in Africa?

Fund Size: **$200,000 USD paid in Ada**

[Campaign page](https://cardano.ideascale.com/a/campaign-home/26108) and [browse ideas](https://cardano.ideascale.com/a/ideas/top/campaign-filter/byids/campaigns/26108/stage/unspecified).

## Campaign Brief

### Africa is fertile ground for the adoption of Cardano.

Having a funding round that focuses on Africa is a win, win, win scenario. Africa wins by getting some backing. Commercial projects that are already building up in Africa win, because they get the signal of support from our community. Cardano holders win when there is an encouraging environment for mass adoption anywhere.

Focussing on Africa is a strategy that has often been promoted and is openly pursued by IOG and Charles Hoskinson

The ROI is likely to be high because community sponsored projects are better run in young and developing economies.

## What this is:

A call to activate the Cardano community's ability to recognise, risk and reward this opportunity to make the world a better place.

## What this is not:

This is not a proposal that needs active work by the proposers, it is a vision that needs votes to become an achievement. If it succeeds the beneficiary is the whole Cardano community. It is a call to close our prejudices and open our eyes, hearts and minds to good people who lack the environmental benefits many of us were born with. Giving them an opportunity to show that circumstances are not something they need charity to rise above and succeed. All that is required is the equal opportunity to succeed or fail that many of the rest of us enjoy, but with their hinderances and hurdles lessened and their choices remaining in their own hands.

## Regardless of whether it succeeds or fails:

I have had my eyes opened and my mind changed about the potential of Africa. From Africa's bankers in the west, ex-pats with vision and heart, youth with passions, documentaries that challenged my assumptions and Cardano community members with so much to give.

## Why is it important?

Cardano shines when adoption is global. Africa currently has young entrepreneurs, great growth potential and a government contract imminent.

## How does success look like?

- Cardano is considered the best public block-chain operating in Africa
- Cardano projects in Africa are not isolated but networked and growing

## Key Metrics to measure

- Number of purely African participants
- Number of Outside African participants with a significant partnership with African residents
- Feedback on progress from successful proposals regardless of failure or success
- Novelty and appropriateness of solutions (hard to quantify, easy to see)
- Number of African Fund5 proposals that do not need further funding to keep operating
