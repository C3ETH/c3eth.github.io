## Campaign Brief

Our SPOs are a most-valuable foundation of Cardano. They have invested in important infrastructure and are establishing important capabilities. This is of high value in the still very much hype-driven general Crypto space. With SPOs, the CARDANO Community can get both: Even more decentralization AND stability and professionalism at the same time.

On this bases, many new ideas and service can emerge, such as

- Secure and censorship-resilient data storage
- KYC related service and access hubs
- Well, for sure many, many more ideas and opportunities

In case of success, I can also see this as a recurring challenge setting, driving and optimising the economic well-being of our SPO's and utilizing all their today's and future capabilities in a most creative way.

## Why is it Important?

Being an SPO shall be economically attractive. In addition to this, there are great opportunities for adding new ideas & services

## How does success look like?

The overall business model of SPO's can become even more attractive and we can add new features and services for driving decentralization

## Key Metrics to measure

- Number of new business ideas for SPOs
- Overall SPO-related business-value of such optional new services
- Impact of essential new services for making the world of Cardano even more decentralized, distributed and censorship resilient
