New to Fund11, proposal submissions have been
organized into new, streamlined categories and a
track-based approach. Proposal categories will now fall
under one of three Categories: Cardano Use cases,
Cardano Open, and Catalyst Systems Improvements.

### Cardano use cases

The total category budget is ₳22,500,000, divided
equally into three funding tracks. Proposal submissions
should answer one of the following:

#### Concept

**Budget**: ₳7,500,000

What DApp ideas or product concepts need
design and prototyping to demonstrate their
purpose and realize novel applications or use
cases of the Cardano blockchain? Submissions
must be for new product ideas.

#### Solution

**Budget**: ₳7,500,000

How can we support early blockchain startup
projects to reach Cardano testnet or MVP
readiness? Submissions must include a functioning
prototype that can be demonstrated in the
proposal. Submissions must supply a proof of
concept available for reviewers and voters.

#### Product

**Budget**: ₳7,500,000

What products and integrations can be
accelerated to offer more high-impact use cases
at scale to drive more adoption in the Cardano
ecosystem? Submissions must have a working
product in the market with high growth potential.
Submissions for R&D must have the proposed
product already in the market, which can be used
by reviewers and voters today.

### Cardano Open

The total category budget is ₳21,000,000, divided
equally into two funding tracks. Technical proposals
should be submitted to the Cardano open: developers
track. Non-technical proposals should be submitted to
the Cardano open: ecosystem track.

#### Developers-technical

**Budget**: ₳10,500,000

What open source tooling is needed to enable the
Cardano developer ecosystem to thrive? The focus
should be on supporting open-source
development efforts.

#### Ecosystem-non-technical

**Budget**: ₳10,500,000

What creative ideas and activities will expand
Project Catalyst's global footprint, educate, and
onboard more Cardano and Cardano DApps users?
The focus should be on supporting non-technical
proposals for marketing, Cardano regional growth,
and community-building endeavors.

### Catalyst System Improvement

The total category budget is ₳3,000,000, divided
equally between two funding tracks:

#### Discovery

**Budget**: ₳1,500,000

What foundational research is required to advance
the existing Project Catalyst system improvement
solutions?

#### Development

**Budget**: ₳1,500,000

Focused on functional engineering to work in
conjunction with or to refine existing or under-
development system improvement solutions.
Focused on Fund Administrator infrastructure to
serve the community's needs better.
