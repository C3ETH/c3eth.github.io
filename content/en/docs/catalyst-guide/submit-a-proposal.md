*This page provides an overview of what Community Reviewers will consider when submitting their opinions*

Community Reviewers will score each proposal between 1-5 for each of the three criteria listed below. They are asked to opine on whether the proposal has clearly outlined its ability to provide a solution within the context of the three criteria:

- IMPACT
- CAPABILITY & FEASIBILITY
- VALUE FOR MONEY

> PLEASE NOTE: Do not assume that every Community Reviewer has technical or subject matter expertise.

## Important questions when formulating your proposal

1. Does your proposal clearly show a positive IMPACT for the Cardano ecosystem and its community? <br/> IMPACT means that the work you do on this project has a real, tangible, and positive effect or influence on the ecosystem. Does the project idea seem as if it has the potential to make a difference? Is the proposed impact realistic and achievable? Does the project team give high levels of confidence and assurances they will keep the community properly updated through correct and regular reporting?
2. Is your project proposal FEASIBLE within the plan and budget submitted? <br/> As part of your proposal submission, you are asked to submit the key milestones you believe are required in order to successfully complete the project and deliver the solution you propose. If your proposal is successful, you will be required to submit a Statement of Milestones at the onboarding stage. More information is available here. Does your team have the skills, experience, CAPABILITY, and capacity to complete the project successfully? Will your project achieve an outstanding result? Is the plan easily understood? Are the outcomes easily verified? Are your timelines and KPIs reasonable and can they be achieved in the timeframe you propose?
3. Does the project represent VALUE FOR MONEY for the Community? <br/> Are the funds requested properly explained, and is the amount of funding requested justified and reasonable? Has the proposal justified why treasury funds are needed? Do you have the team RESOURCES available, or are there gaps in your team that you need to hire for? Remember that all costs must be calculated in ada.

Your proposal should present a clear path to your project’s successful completion and clearly explain the impact and outputs of what you are developing (‘by developing X we will be able to do A,B,C which can be measured by 1, 2, 3, which will mean Y, Z type of positive impact for the community and Cardano’).
