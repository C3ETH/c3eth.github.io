##### Proposal title

  >Please note we suggest you use no more than 60 characters for your proposal title so that it can be easily viewed in the voting app

Minimum 2 months - Maximum 12 months.
​
The scope of your funding request and this project is expected to produce the deliverables you specify in the proposal within 2-12 months.
​
If you believe your project will take longer than 12 months, consider reducing the project’s scope so that it becomes achievable within 12 months.
​
If your project completes earlier than scheduled so long as you have submitted your PoAs and Project Completion report and video then your project can be closed out

##### Please indicate if your proposal has been auto-translated into English from another language.

YES/NO - Tick YES to remind readers that your proposal has been translated, and that they should be tolerant of any language imperfections.
​
You can either link a document with your proposal in its original language OR provide your response in your native language after the English language in each question if you wish.
​
Tick NO if your proposal has not been auto- translated into English from another language

##### What is the exact problem you want to solve? (200-character limit including spaces)

Ensure you say what is a well-defined problem. What is the core issue that you hope to fix? Remember: the reader might not recognize the problem unless you state it clearly.
​
This answer will be displayed on the Catalyst voting app, so voters will see it even if they don't open your proposal to read it in detail.

##### Summarize your solution to the problem (200-character limit including spaces)

Focus on what you are going to do, or make, or change, to solve the problem. So not 'There should be a way to....' but 'We will make a...'
​
Clearly state how the solution addresses the specific problem you have identified - connect the 'why' and the 'how'.
​
This answer will be displayed on the Catalyst voting app, so voters will see it even if they do not open your proposal and read it in detail.

##### Website/ GitHub repository, or any other relevant link (Optional)

Here, you could include links to your website or that of a partner organization, and/or a link to any whitepaper or other publication you have written about your proposal.
​
Note however that this is extra information that voters and Community Reviewers might choose not to read. You should not fail to include any of the questions in this form because you feel the answers can be found elsewhere.
​
If any links are specified make sure these are added in good order (first link must be present before specifying second). Also ensure all links include ‘https.’ Without these steps, the form will not be submittable and show errors.

##### Does your project have any dependencies on other organizations, technical or otherwise?

  YES/NO

##### If YES, please describe what the dependency is and why you believe it is essential for your project’s delivery. If NO, please write “No dependencies.”

Here you should list any dependencies and prerequisites for your project’s success. These are usually external factors (such as third-party suppliers, external resources, third-party software, etc.) that may cause a delay, since a project has less control over them. In case of third party software, indicate whether you have the necessary licenses and permission to use such software.

##### Will your project’s output/s be fully open source?

YES/NO

 >Open Source refers to something people can modify and share because its design is publicly accessible. Open source software is software with source code that anyone can inspect, modify, and enhance.
>​
>Conversely, only the original authors of proprietary software can legally copy, inspect, and alter that software.

If you answered YES to the above questions

Please indicate here the type of licence you intend to use  for open source and provide any further information you feel is relevant to the open source status of your project outputs.

<details>
  <summary>RESOURCES</summary>

#### Who is in the project team and what are their roles? Please add the relevant Linkedin profiles (or similar) here

List your team, their Linkedin profiles (or similar) and state what aspect of the proposal’s work each team member will undertake.<br/>
​
If you are planning to recruit additional team members, please state what specific skills you will be looking for in the people you recruit, so readers can see that you understand what skills will be needed to complete the project.<br/>
​
You are expected to have already engaged the relevant members of the organizations referenced so you understand if they are willing and/or have capacity to support the project. <br/>
If you have not taken any steps to engage with your team yet, it is likely that the resources will not be available if you are approved for funding, which can jeopardize the project before it has even begun. The Catalyst team cannot help with this, meaning you are expected to have understood the requirements and engaged the necessary people before submitting a proposal.<br/>
​
Have you engaged anyone on any of the technical group channels (eg Discord or Telegram), or do you have a direct line of communications with the people and resources required?<br/>
​
***Important:** Catalyst funding is not anonymous, and some level of ‘proof of life’ verifications will take place before initial funding is released. Also remember that your proposal will be publicly available, so make sure to obtain any consent required before including confidential or third party information.*
