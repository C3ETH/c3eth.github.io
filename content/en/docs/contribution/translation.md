Thank you for your interest in translating (localizing) C3ETH Documents ðŸ˜Š
Your work makes the documents more accessible and more widely available to our worldwide community.

ðŸ‘‰ Please follow the guidelines below to help translate C3ETH Documents.</br>

## Steps to participate in C3ETH docs translations:

1. Open the [GITLOCALIZATION_CONTRIBUTORS](https://github.com/C3ETH/c3eth.github.io/blob/main/GITLOCALIZE_CONTRIBUTORS.md) file. Look for the language header that you'd like to contribute to and add **your full name and @your_github_account** under the header. If you cannot find the language that you'd like to contribute to, please read [this section](#how-to-add-a-new-language).
2. Create a pull request (PR) to add your name to the list. Make sure to follow the template to open a PR.<br/>
Each contributor must create their own PR<br/>
If you have an open discuss for a language request, *add the discuss link to the PR*.
3. Join [GitLocalize](https://gitlocalize.com) using the same GitHub ID you used to open your PR above.
4. Leave a comment in your PR stating that you successfully joined GitLocalize.
5. Once your PR has been accepted and merged, you will receive a notification from GitLocalize with a title: `[GitLocalize] You have been assigned a new role.`
6. Join project [C3ETH/c3eth.github.io] and then visit the language you signed up to contribute to.<br/>

For questions about the project, to connect with other translators, or to receive updates regarding the project, please join [our community discussion](https://github.com/C3ETH/c3eth.github.io/discussions).

## What is GitLocalize?

[GitLocalize](https://gitlocalize.com) is a platform for managing translations of the content stored on GitHub and simplifies the translation workflow for developers.

**Note**:<br/>
> Gitlocalize is under active development, so you may encounter issues during translation. If you find bugs or errors, please feel free to reach out to [our community](https://github.com/C3ETH/c3eth.github.io/discussions).

## How to add a new language?

If you want to add a new language, you can open a [GitHub idea](https://github.com/C3ETH/c3eth.github.io/discussions/categories/ideas) to start a discussion with the C3ETH team and recruit translation project members.

## How to add my name to GITLOCALIZATION_CONTRIBUTORS list and open a PR in GitHub?

**Option 1: In Github (Recommended)**
1. Click on the pen-like button which says "Edit this file" in the [GITLOCALIZATION_CONTRIBUTORS](https://github.com/C3ETH/c3eth.github.io/blob/main/GITLOCALIZE_CONTRIBUTORS.md) file.
2. Add your name under the language you'd like to contribute to.
3. Once your name is added, scroll down and find a green button which says "Propose changes".
4. The page now reloads automatically and find and click on another green button - "Create pull request".
5. This should create the pull request and once that's done, follow the [instructions](#steps-to-participate-in-c3eth-docs-translations) (steps 3, 4, 5).

**Option 2: Creating a local clone of the repository and pushing from local**
1. Clone this repository by following [this guide](https://docs.github.com/en/github/creating-cloning-and-archiving-repositories/cloning-a-repository-from-github/cloning-a-repository).
2. Make sure your local git configuration by following the instructions here -- [Setting username](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/getting-started-with-git/setting-your-username-in-git) and [Setting email](https://docs.github.com/en/github/setting-up-and-managing-your-github-user-account/managing-email-preferences/setting-your-commit-email-address#setting-your-commit-email-address-in-git)
3. Create a branch by running `git checkout -b BRANCH_NAME` in your terminal.
4. Find `GITLOCALIZATION_CONTRIBUTORS` file in your local copy of [C3ETH/c3eth.github.io] (created after cloning this repository) and add your name under the language you'd like to contribute to.
5. Now, in the terminal run `git add GITLOCALIZATION_CONTRIBUTORS`, `git commit -m "Added name under LANGUAGE-NAME"`, `git push origin BRANCH-NAME`.
6. Follow the link in the terminal to open a pull request.
