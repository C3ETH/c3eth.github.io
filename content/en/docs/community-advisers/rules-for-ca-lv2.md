- All reviews should be provided to voters if a Community Moderator has good reason not to include it.
- Community Moderators are anticipated to approve many flagged reviews and will be retained for voters to consider.
- Moderators are there to provide a sanity check to verify if the flag(s) have raised a valid concern.
- Moderators should use their best judgment and give a reason if they agree the flag is valid, meaning the review should not be included.
- Most reviews will be displayed in the voting application, meaning only those legitimately flagged and tagged by LV2 Moderators will not be included.
- A simple majority forms a consensus about including the review or not. In a scenario whereby 2 moderators (or an equal number of moderators on each side of the decision) do not form a consensus about including the review, then the benefit of the doubt will be given and the review included.
  - In a scenario where only 1 moderator checks a review, the Catalyst will fulfill the second necessary moderation
  - In a scenario where flagged or spot-checked reviews go without moderation by either LV2 moderators allocated to check, the Catalyst team will fulfill the moderation duty.
