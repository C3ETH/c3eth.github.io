## How do I progress through the Community Reviewer levels?

#### For Fund10

For each previously held Proposal Assessor (PA) ID, based on the past performance of old funds, the relative percentage of valid assessments submitted that were either Excellent OR Good, is a qualifying factor to determine a LV0, LV1, or LV2 Community Review level.
This parameter allows setting a minimum % of valid assessments to qualify previously held PA IDs in Fund10. In order to qualify as a LV1 in Fund10, a previously held PA ID must have completed a minimum of 10 reviews with a threshold of at least 70% valid assessments submitted from their total work.

In order to qualify as a LV2 in Fund10, this threshold is set at 20 reviews with at least 80% valid assessments submitted from their total work and active participation as PA in the last fund (F9) is required. In Fund10 Cardano Ambassadors have also been invited to participate in LV2 Moderation as they have already been recognized as capable Cardano community contributors, helping encourage others to keep within Cardano Community code of conduct.

#### After Fund10

A retrospective should be held to learn how the new Community Review stage operated in practice and determine where the community participation levels can be further refined based on the data collected. This will help to determine what the starting lines and ways to progress through the levels should be for the next funding round.

## Community Reviewers Levels

All reviewers are able to provide their opinions in exactly the same way as each other. The difference being is that for more experienced reviewers, there are more opportunities to support Catalyst processes and receive rewards.

### LV0

>LV0 Community Reviewers are ALL new reviewers and less experienced reviewers.

Consider yourself at the ground floor and Catalyst wants you to get used to performing the role. LV0 reviewers will share in a pot of rewards incentives. The larger the pool of LV0 reviews and reviewers, the less per review each reviewer will receive. LV0 Reviewers will be invited to review up to 30 proposals and will be allocated an initial set of proposals to review based on proposals across the entire fund (unable to choose specific challenges).

### LV1

>LV1 Reviewers have already performed a substantial number of reviews.

LV1 Reviewers will be invited to review up to 80 proposals and will be allocated an initial set of proposals to review based on challenge preferences selected during the registration process.

### LV2

>LV2 Reviewers (Community Moderators) will perform a Community “Moderator” function to check any reviews that have been flagged by the Catalyst scripts.

Community Moderators will not alter the review or the scores provided by the Community Reviewers meaning reviewers shouldn’t feel afraid to provide honest opinions and objective scores. Instead Community Moderators are asked to make a determination whether reviews that were flagged by the Catalyst scripts should be published or discarded altogether.  Community Moderators will also perform a random spot check on a small percentage of total reviews submitted by LV0 and LV1 reviewers.  In Fund10 each LV0 and LV1 review that is selected for moderation will be checked by a minimum of two LV2 Community Moderators.


## Community Reviewers Rewards

### LV0 Rewards

LV0 reviewers will receive a *maximum of 25 ada per review*. This amount could be less if LV0 reviewers completed many more reviews. LV0 gets rewarded only for allocated reviews. To receive rewards, LV0 must have at least 10 valid reviews. The pot of given LV0 rewards includes the overflow of additional LV1 reviews that exceed the LV1 reviewer’s auto-allocation, added to the LV0 pool of published reviews.

### LV1 Rewards

LV1s can expect a *fixed amount of 50 ada per allocated review*. If the LV1 reviewer wants to perform more reviews beyond the assigned allocation, then every additional published review will be compensated for the LV0 pot of rewards. To receive rewards, LV1 must have at least 10 valid reviews, including assigned and additional reviews. Any number of reviews under this amount will not be rewarded.

>An LV0/LV1 reviewer is excluded (and will not receive rewards) if their work doesn't meet a 35% approval rate (with a minimum sample of 5 moderated reviews) after the moderation stage.

### LV2 Rewards

LV2s can expect to receive a *maximum of 5 ada per flag check*. The effort here is anticipated to be straightforward and quick for each flagged review.
