This tutorial will show you how to transfer `SC_Tokens` between the main chain and a sidechain.

#### Prerequisites

1.  We will use the **sidechain-cli** within this tutorial. Download the binary and add it to your shellâ€™s path: [https://github.com/input-output-hk/sidechains-tooling/releases](https://github.com/input-output-hk/sidechains-tooling/releases).
2.  Download the **bech32** conversion tool binary and add to your shell's path: [https://github.com/input-output-hk/bech32](https://github.com/input-output-hk/bech32).
3.  If you have not done so already, create and fund your main chain and sidechain accounts: [Create and fund your accounts](/cardano-sidechains/example-evm-sidechain/create-and-fund-accounts).

## Transfering tokens from a sidechain to the main chain

Transferring `SC_Token` from a sidechain to the main chain will require interfacing with the bridge smart contract to lock your desired amount of `SC_Token` to be claimed on the main chain. In this guide, you will use RemixIDE to interface with the bridge contract.

### Step 01 - Setup contract interface in RemixIDE

*   Go to [https://remix.ethereum.org/](https://remix.ethereum.org/)

*   Create `/contracts/bridge.abi` with the following contents: [bridge.abi](https://github.com/input-output-hk/sidechains-tooling/blob/master/bridge.abi)


_Note: Make sure your Remix-compatible Web3 provider is configured to the EVM sidechain testnet. Eg: MetaMask._

*   In Remix, go to **Deploy and Run transactions** > select **Injected Provider (MetaMask)** for the environment > Load contract from address (`0x696f686b2e6d616d626100000000000000000000`)

Your RemixIDE will look similar to this with a contract interface:
![remix ide](https://docs.cardano.org/static/ab33f7a92f97f83aaf381cc0859d1c76/eb3fa/remix-ide.png)

### Step 02 - Lock SC_Token

The `lock` function of the bridge contract takes the main-chain recipient's address, but **the recipient address must be converted to bech32 format**.

*   Convert main-chain address to bech32 format:

```bash
./bech32 <<< addr_test1vpzhx6enc57e75n2ygcgdt7cz2c8akt5rk5qaxy7j6vc3ycgly0wh
6045736b33c53d9f526a223086afd812b07ed9741da80e989e96998893 #Returns the conversion
```

To ensure the address is recognized as a HEX string simply add `0x` to the beginning of the converted address, eg: `0x6045736b33c53d9f526a223086afd812b07ed9741da80e989e96998893`

*   Determine how many `SC_Token` you want to lock. The amount in `SC_Token` has to be a multiple of 10^9. For example, 10^9 `wei` on the sidechain will be 1 `SC_Token` on the main chain. Input the amount of `SC_Token`, in `wei`, you want to lock: eg, `1000000000` Wei == 1 `SC_Token`. Your Remix should look similar to this:

![lock token](https://docs.cardano.org/static/0f6c8506054c5166e4c4256d678a476d/b2982/remix-lock-token.png)

*   Select the `lock` button to initiate the transaction and follow the MetaMask prompts to confirm and sign the transaction.

_Note: If the transaction appears to be stuck, 'pending' status, or MetaMask shows an invalid balance, try [resetting MetaMask](https://metamask.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/360015488891-How-to-reset-an-account) and submit the transaction again._

*   To get the transaction hash or verify that the transaction was successful, you can check MetaMask activity or the Remix console:
![meta](https://docs.cardano.org/static/1820b9d367bf00bc62def2b33459f441/076ca/remix-console.png)

*   Alternatively, you can invoke the `eth_getTransactionReceipt` API method. You can request this until the receipt is returned or transaction times out:

```bash
curl -L -X POST -H 'Content-type:application/json' -d '{
"jsonrpc": "2.0",
"method": "eth_getTransactionReceipt",
"params": [INSERT_RAW_TX],
"id": 1
}' https://faucet.sidechain.evmtestnet.iohkdev.io/ | jq
```

### Step 03 - Wait for transaction to be processed and obtain MerkleProof

*   Get the current sidechain status by invoking `sidechain_getStatus`:

```bash
curl -L -X POST -H 'Content-type:application/json' -d '{
   "jsonrpc": "2.0",
   "method": "sidechain_getStatus",
   "params": [],
   "id": 1
   }' https://faucet.sidechain.evmtestnet.iohkdev.io/ | jq -r
```

This shows on which epoch and phase the `lock()` transaction happened. If it happened during epoch `N` on epochPhase `regular` you can obtain the Merkle proof on epoch `N` since epochPhase changes to `handover`. If it happened during epoch `N` on epochPhase `closedTransactionBatch` or `handover`, you can obtain the Merkle proof on epoch `N+1` since epochPhase changes to `handover`.

*   Get transaction index for the epoch the lock transaction will be processed by invoking the `sidechain_getOutgoingTransactions` API method:

```bash
curl -L -X POST -H 'Content-type:application/json' -d '{
  "jsonrpc": "2.0",
  "method": "sidechain_getOutgoingTransactions",
  "params": [<N or N+1>],
  "id": 1
  }' https://faucet.sidechain.evmtestnet.iohkdev.io/ | jq
```

Example output:

```json
{
  "jsonrpc": "2.0",
  "result": {
    "transactions": [
      {
        "value": "0x1",
        "recipient": "0x6041e633c6b54572165a1563291c147dadb803667c99fc8c55ff3762fb",
        "txIndex": 0
      }
    ]
  },
  "id": 1
}
```

To obtain the `merkleProof` matching the recipient and amount used to lock tokens, proceed as follows.

*   Wait until the epochPhase changes to `handover` of epoch `N` or `N+1` and obtain the Merkle proof for your lock action by invoking the `sidechain_getOutgoingTxMerkleProof` API method:

```bash
curl -L -X POST -H 'Content-type:application/json' -d '{
  "jsonrpc": "2.0",
  "method": "sidechain_getOutgoingTxMerkleProof",
  "params": [<N or N+1>, <txIndex>],
  "id": 1
  }' https://faucet.sidechain.evmtestnet.iohkdev.io/ | jq
```

Example:

```bash
curl -L -X POST https://faucet.sidechain.evmtestnet.iohkdev.io/ -H 'Content-type:application/json' -d '{"jsonrpc": "2.0", "method": "sidechain_getOutgoingTxMerkleProof", "params": [1295, 1], "id": 1}' | jq

{
  "jsonrpc": "2.0",
  "result": {
    "proof": {
      "bytes": "0xd8799fd8799f0101581d6045736b33c53d9f526a223086afd812b07ed9741da80e989e96998893d8799f5820772485d60f6744cf252f26560413aae8d28c82a88b1c77eede792f28965f4e79ffff9fd8799f005820ed69142610619b748ec5cd657e418c1c891c3a176900376d12db0b3c406a0a38ffffff",
      "info": {
        "transaction": {
          "value": "0x1",
          "recipient": "0x6045736b33c53d9f526a223086afd812b07ed9741da80e989e96998893",
          "txIndex": 1
        },
        "merkleRootHash": "0xaacd27079b9c8b8bd17693beccb8997b4b7b1ef97596018d43047a40dab6b021"
      }
    },
    "sidechainEpoch": 1295
  },
  "id": 1
}
```

From the return you need to obtain the `proof/bytes` and remove the `0x` that is prepended. Call that string `merkleProof`.

_In the above example `d8799fd8799...` is the Merkle proof._

Wait until the epoch changes and the committee handover has happened.

_Note: A sidechain epoch is 1 hour; 30 minutes in the `regular` phase, 15 minutes in `closedTxBatch` phase, and 15 minutes in `handover` phase._

The committee handover happens automatically on the testnets by a service (relay) that tries every minute to find epoch signatures, and succeeds after a new epoch has started and the signatures are obtained. On mainnet, the committee handover will be done by anyone who wants, where there will be an incentive to do so. A good way to verify this is to wait until you observe your transaction in the list of signatures to upload:

```bash
curl -L -X POST -H 'Content-type:application/json' -d '{
    "jsonrpc": "2.0",
    "method": "sidechain_getSignaturesToUpload",
    "params": [<limit>],
    "id": 1
    }' https://faucet.sidechain.evmtestnet.iohkdev.io/ | jq
```

Where `limit` = min(limit, number of epochs that are not yet relayed). The default value is `100`, but you can set it to any other number. Normally, when the handover happens at every epoch, it should only show 0 or 1 epochs (the last one). Once you identify that there are no roothashes pending in the list under the epoch that your lock was processed (`N` or `N+1`), you can claim your tokens. By now the epoch will be `N+1` or `N+2`, depending on the phase you performed the lock operation in.

### Step 04 - Claim SC\_Token

*   Claim the tokens by submitting a transaction on the main chain with the `merkleProof` you obtained using the **sidechain-cli**. You will need to sign the transaction with your main chain signing key (ex: `payment.skey`):

```bash
./sidechain-cli claim-sc-token \
--sc-evm-url https://faucet.sidechain.evmtestnet.iohkdev.io \
--signing-key-file /PATH/TO/payment.skey \
--combined-proof <merkleProof without 0x>
```

Example output:

```json
{
  "endpoint": "ClaimAct",
  "transactionId": "1334b3dab421911af68b9393e5cc4756c46c9ab1ac567a57450597e174351a48"
}
```

ðŸŽ‰ Congratulations! At this point, you have successfully claimed your SC_Token on the main chain.

## Transfering tokens from the main chain to a sidechain

### Step 01 - Burn SC_Token

To transfer SC_Token from the main chain to a sidechain, use the sidechain-cli to burn main-chain SC_Token.

```bash
./sidechain-cli burn-sc-token \
--signing-key-file payment.skey \
--sc-evm-url https://faucet.sidechain.evmtestnet.iohkdev.io/ \
--recipient ae3dffee97f92db0201d11cb8877c89738353bce \
--amount 10
```

*   `--signing-key-file payment.skey`: Generating a main-chain account creates a `.skey` file to sign transactions. The command gives the path to this file.

*   `--sc-evm-url https://faucet.sidechain.evmtestnet.iohkdev.io/`: Providing the JSON-RPC API url, or endpoint, to the sidechain network node.

*   `--recipient ae3dffee97f92db0201d11cb8877c89738353bce`: Defines the destination address on the sidechain where the SC\_Token tokens will appear.

*   `--amount 10`: Defines the amount of `SC_Token` (on the main chain) to be burned for `SC_Token` (on the sidechain) at the conversion rate of `amount`x`10^9`.


The transaction will be stable on the main chain in approximately 12 minutes or 36 blocks. The sidechain will then add it to a produced block and the tokens should appear in the sidechain-account balance:

*   Check `SC_Token` token balance using the [JSON-RPC API](/cardano-sidechains/example-evm-sidechains/api):

```bash
curl -L -X POST https://faucet.sidechain.evmtestnet.iohkdev.io/ -H 'Content-type:application/json' -d '{
    "jsonrpc": "2.0",
    "method": "eth_getBalance",
    "params": ["0xae3dffee97f92db0201d11cb8877c89738353bce", "latest"],
    "id": 1}'
```

Tip: Balance may be checked on a compatible Web3 wallet configured to the EVM sidechain testnet network.

ðŸŽ‰ Congratulations! At this point, you have successfully burned your main chain `SC_Token` for a native sidechain `SC_Token`.
