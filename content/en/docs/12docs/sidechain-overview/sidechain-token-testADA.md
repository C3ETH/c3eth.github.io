## What is SC_Token?

`SC_Token`*(temporary name)* is the native token of the Cardano EVM sidechain Testnet. `SC_Token` can be moved between the main chain (Cardano) and the example EVM sidechain, and `SC_Token` is required to pay for gas. Test `SC_Token` carries no real-world value.

## What is gas?

Gas refers to the computational cost necessary to successfully conduct a transaction on the sidechain network. This gas is deducted from a small fraction of `SC_Token` when conducting a transaction, deploying a smart contract, or writing to a smart contract.

## How to get SC_Token?

IO Global maintains a faucet at <https://faucet.sidechain.evmtestnet.iohkdev.io/> for testing purposes. The faucet dispenses test SC_Token that you can use to pay the gas fees on smart contracts that you run on the EVM sidechain testnet. You can claim one test SC_Token every 24 hours. You cannot swap the test SC_Token tokens you claim from the faucet for any other token, nor can you use them to make any purchases.

## What is Test Ada?

Test Ada `(tAda)` is the native token of the dedicated Cardano testnet (separate from the preview and pre-production testing environments). `tAda` is required to pay for transaction fees conducted on the Cardano testnet. `tAD` a carries no real world value.

## How to get tAda?

IO Global maintains a faucet at <https://faucet.cardano.evmtestnet.iohkdev.io/basic-faucet> for testing purposes.
