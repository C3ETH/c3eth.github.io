Solidity is a statically-typed curly-braces programming language designed for developing smart contracts that run on Ethereum. Because its syntax is similar to ECMAScript, it will be familiar to many developers. There are significant differences, including:

* Solidity is compiled rather than interpreted
* It is a statically-typed language
* It has variadic return types.

## The home page

Its home is [Soliditylang.org](https://soliditylang.org/). That is the place to start if you are new to the language; if you are experienced, no doubt you will already be familiar with the site.
