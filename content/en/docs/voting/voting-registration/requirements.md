## Important Information

- If you registered in Fund4, Fund5, Fund6, Fund7, Fund8 and/or Fund9 and were able to cast votes - your registration will be automatically valid for Fund10 to cast votes but not to receive rewards (provided you still have your QR and PIN code you don't need to re-register). This does not apply to Fund2 or Fund3 registrations.
- Your voting power will be updated during the new snapshot.
- Please note that iPhone 6 and before are not supported.
- Regardless of your wallet, each registration will provide you with a unique QR and PIN code. These must absolutely be saved. No QR code saved, no vote! No PIN code saved, no vote!
