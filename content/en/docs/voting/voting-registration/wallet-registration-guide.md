## Supported wallets

Due to the large number of wallets and wallet versions, it is not possible for Project Catalyst to validate this data in all circumstances and is not endorsed by Project Catalyst. You can check if your registration is successful [here](https://verify.testnet.projectcatalyst.io/)

Registrations should be detected in most cases after 2 hours, but could take up to 24 Hours. If a new registration does not show up after 24 hours, please check with your wallet provider.

## In your Daedalus wallet

- Confirm that you have installed the Catalyst Voting app.
