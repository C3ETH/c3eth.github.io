## Catalyst TV - ATALA Prism zKP + Hyperledger Aries

- [Ideascale](https://cardano.ideascale.com/c/idea/414008)
- **Challenge:** Cross-Chain Collaboration
- **Requested Budget:** 82000
- **Proposer:** Mr Ninh Tran

ðŸŒŸ ATALA Prism and RootsID don't support zero-Knowledge Proofs and Predicates and are currently not interoperable with Hyperledger Aries or W3C OBv3. Prism is only on Testnet. Let's get ATALA on Mainnet. Build zero-Knowledge Proof and Predicate integration layer for ATALA Prism on RootsID CLI-WAL wallet and make them interoperable with Hyperledger Aries and W3C OBv3.
