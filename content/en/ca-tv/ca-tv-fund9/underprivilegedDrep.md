## Catalyst TV - Underprivileged DREPS Campaigning

- [Ideascale](https://cardano.ideascale.com/c/idea/421816)
- **Challenge:** dRep improvement and onboarding
- **Requested Budget:** 19600
- **Proposer:** Mr Alex


We need Dreps representing diverse regions and cultures. Those Dreps living in underprivileged countries will find difficult to achieve saturation, creating inefficiencies in the governance. To allow these Dreps to achieve saturation (1% of the total stake) we will provide a campaigning funds and office, so their voices and platforms can be heard abroad, reaching whales and main countries
