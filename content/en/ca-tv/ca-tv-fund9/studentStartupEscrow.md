## Catalyst TV - Student Startup escrow (SSE)

- [Ideascale](https://cardano.ideascale.com/c/idea/418445)
- **Challenge:** Challenge & Scouted for StudentsðŸŽ“
- **Proposer:** Mr Stockpicka
- **Requested Budget:** 5000

ðŸ‘‰  Students have a limited amount of funds and can not risk being scammed by developers and freelancers. There needs to be consumer protection when young startups outsource jobs and goods. Make a smart escrow that promotes collaboration and authenticity when buying and selling goods. Which protects the consumer if the producer ever attempts to be malicious.
