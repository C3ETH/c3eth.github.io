## Catalyst TV - Telegram Wallet Upgrade

- [Ideascale](https://cardano.ideascale.com/c/idea/420625)
- **Challenge:** Dapps, Products & Integrations
- **Requested Budget:** 17600
- **Proposer:** Mr Nebiyu

The Endubis Telegram wallet requires more features in order to onboard a large audience to the Cardano community and the De-Fi world. In addition to its basic non-custodial wallet function, we will add features for cNFT displays, incorporate a P2P exchange, and integrate with Defi platforms to enable swaps, lending, and borrowing.
