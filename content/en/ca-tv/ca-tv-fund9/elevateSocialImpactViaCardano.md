ðŸŒŸ There are over 20,000 social enterprises in Vietnam yet start-up social enterprises don't have much financial support to execute their work while Ada holders have lack of trusted platforms to donate. Engage Ada holders to stake their Ada to Stake Pools. Stake Pool owners will donate x% profit to social enterprises (SEs), we will also help SEs build reporting framework and due diligence documents.
