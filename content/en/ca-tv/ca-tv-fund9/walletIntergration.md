ðŸŒŸ Goodwall constantly sends out monetary prizes to youth. Itâ€™s a burden to send out bank payments internationally and a lot of the fintech options can be cost prohibitive. Goodwall will integrate with the Yoroi wallet for web and mobile, allowing for instant payouts of ADA. Users who are awarded a prize will only need to enter their wallet ID to relieve payments.
