## Catalyst TV - Advanced Cardano NFT Search Engine

- [Ideascale](https://cardano.ideascale.com/c/idea/414201)
- **Challenge:** Dapps, Products & Integrations
- **Requested Budget:** 56550
- **Proposer:** Mr Gianni & Anthony


ðŸŒŸ Cardano lacks any advanced, ecosystem-wide, NFT search and discovery tools. This makes NFT markets inefficient, limiting adoption and reducing market liquidity. Build a fast Cardano NFT search engine with faceted search functionality - enhanced by Argusâ€™ image similarity (machine learning), and designed to accommodate future multi-chain support.
