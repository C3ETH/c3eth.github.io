## Catalyst TV - WALLET ADD-ONS FOR GAME ENGINE

There is no wallet add-on for the game engine client in Cardano that suits the requirement of Miverse in long-term development. In the scope of this proposal, they're running with 2 senior blockchain developers. For making the project succeed, we're working hard with 4 teams of game development, comic production, and marketing with 50+ people.
