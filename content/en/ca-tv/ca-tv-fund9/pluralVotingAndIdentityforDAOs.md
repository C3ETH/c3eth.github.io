## Catalyst TV - Plural Voting and Identity for DAOs

- [Ideascale](https://cardano.ideascale.com/c/idea/413998)
- **Challenge:** DAOs Cardano
- **Requested Budget:** 91000

👉  See the team's other [proposals](https://linktr.ee/votesnapbrillia)

👉  DAOs in & out of Cardano don't have access to more advanced voting systems with Sybil resistance and resort to 1-coin-1-vote that doesn't always resolve in optimal decisions, funding, & collaboration. Plural Voting with Proof of Reputation, Identity, and Quadratic Sybil Resistance to improve DAO Governance for all without requiring full KYC to increase voter participation and lower voting disparity
