## Catalyst TV - Marlowe Course for Vietnam Devs

- [Ideascale](https://cardano.ideascale.com/c/idea/416191)
- **Challenge:** Developer Ecosystem
- **Requested Budget:** 26900

🌟 Developers in Vietnam are difficulty with Haskell, and Plutus programming languages, so it is challenging to start with building an application that integrates with Blockchain Cardano. Introducing a free course to make the Cardano blockchain easy for new developers. This is the first step for talented developers to dive deeper into the Cardano blockchain world.
