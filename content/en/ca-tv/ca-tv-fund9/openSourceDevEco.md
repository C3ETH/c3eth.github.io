Growing a marketplace & ecosystem of experts able to work on complex software is important to build and maintain the foundations of Cardano. the OSDE challenge aims to provide a stream of resources to teams that want to develop their projects and contribute back to the community by sharing part of their efforts in terms of open source projects, open-source frameworks, and accessible knowledge.
