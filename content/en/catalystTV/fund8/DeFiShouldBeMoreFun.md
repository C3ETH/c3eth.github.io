Entrepreneur - Currently, CEO of 5+ years social media marketing agency.

>“I’m a game lover and also my life is passionate with fiction stories, space, and science. Now, with the motivation from the Catalyst community, I decided to “write” the story that will inspire everyone to space and a new metaverse. With my 10+ years of launching and operating new businesses and the support of my current marketing agency. I believe that we can make this idea to the moon.

##### **Andy Nguyen**
CEO of Unicorn Studio - Having more than 8 years of developing games for the Korean market for big companies like KakaoTalk, OllehStore, OzStore, TStore, and Facebook Instant Game. Many years of experience in making mobile applications, windows os, Mac os, and websites and graduated with a master's degree in data science. I am just starting to research and develop blockchain but feel that this is a very early market and there are many opportunities ahead so I decided to devote all my heart to the blockchain. 

The combination of my many years of game-making experience and my experience in researching and implementing a few blockchain projects will definitely help in the completion of this project. I also hope that in the process of working on the project, I will be able to create valuable research papers for the blockchain academic community.

##### **Christian Ho**
Founder of Unicorn Studio - Having more than 11 years of developing games, 5 years of PM, and 6 years of tech lead for many game projects as you can check the info in the attached file below. A year ago, when I met Mr. Dat, he is just a young entrepreneur without any experience in the gaming industry. Even he had a lot of experience in launching various kinds of business but a gaming business is not an easy one at all. However, his entrepreneurship and the ambition vision of Miverse motivated me to join it. I believe that in our ability and experience, we are sure that we can help Miverse pass its first phases and keep moving further in the future. For the bigger picture, we are eager to learn and make it.
