### FIMI's Community
Founded by Mr. Do Manh Hung (master of finance) in 2016, we focus on training the community to know and change their mind in financial and investment management. When the crypto market emerged in 2017, we realized that blockchain and crypto are the future trends of human beings, so we focused on finding investment opportunities in the blockchain field. Luckily, we found a great project, which is Cardano.

During the past 5 years, we have built a youtube channel dedicated to Cardano. As of March 15, 2022, the channel has achieved:

More than 120 Cardano and Blockchain videos published
More than 15000 channel subscribers
More than 554,000 views
More than 138,000 hours of watch
