## Catalyst TV - dRep tool for non-English speakers

- [Ideascale](https://cardano.ideascale.com/c/idea/414969)
- **Challenge:** dRep improvement and onboarding
- **Requested Budget:** 26500

🌟 The busy dReps in non-English communities don't have enough time and language skills to select and vote on the right proposals. This affects the efficiency of voting delegation. We propose to create a searchable tool for dRep use and save time. It contains the proposal summary’s content and review in 3 languages: English, Japanese, and Vietnamese.
