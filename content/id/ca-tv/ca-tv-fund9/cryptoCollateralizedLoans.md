## Catalyst TV - Crypto collateralized loans

- [Ideascale](https://cardano.ideascale.com/c/idea/422635)
- **Proposer:** Lending Pond
- **Requested Budget:** 30000

Users can not borrow against their ADA in a non-KYC solution. The lending Pond team will make an order book-style lending and borrowing platform for fungible tokens.

- It will use smart contracts and go lang. This allows people to de-risk themselves.
