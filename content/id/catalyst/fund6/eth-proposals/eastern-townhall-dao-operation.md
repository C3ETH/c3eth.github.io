## Problem statement
Difficult to participate in Catalyst for eastern part.Because(1) time zone (2) language (non-English) is different from the western part.

## Describe your solution to the problem
Operation of Eastern TownHall (Translate / event / meet-up by Eastern countries.)Increased Eastern participants by 20% for each FUND

## Relevant experience
Co-Founders of Catalyst Swarm, Eastern Townhall, Catalyst School. IT & Software Engineering. educators and accountant in East Asia & Japan.

## Detailed plan
The Eastern Townhall is a community-driven initiative growing Cardano in the Eastern Hemisphere and across Asia. We want to build a truly global economy and society. Our focus is on making the hard, possible. A place, a time, and a space where:

* We can build knowledge, share information, connect and support each other.
* Language and culture are not an barrier to participation.
* We learn how to apply the technology, and community, to address local needs.
* Show how to use Cardano to increase our economic wellbeing.
* Enrich Cardano's ecosystem with our stories, our energy, and our perspectives.

The eastern hemisphere, East and Southeast Asia region unite culturally and linguistically a lot of countries. With a population of over 1.6 Billion, our goal is to grow Cardano. 

### Current Problems and Limitation

The Eastern Townhall is the result of individuals and groups working together. Each bringing a unique quality. We interact in and around the Cardano Community, focused on linking individuals and projects to Project Catalyst. But this takes time, effort, and incurs expenses. Having no pool of funds to draw upon limits what we can achieve.

### Proposed Solution: Pool of Funds

To reach a global audience means meeting people where they are, in their country, their language and their culture. 

We are an active part of our Cardano ecosystem. Our cornerstone event is the weekly Eastern Townhalls. But we are doing more, so much more:

* We make knowledge and content accessible to as many cultures as possible.
* We host different events where community members come together
* We bridges to underrepresented groups
* We integrate local perspectives to enrich the Catalyst Community; and
* We listen! Gathering opinions and data to help us all understand.

**We are doing translations, building community, sharing knowledge, enabling entrepreneurs, and growing Cardano.**

Doing all that has costs, so if we are to sustain the Eastern Townhall efforts, then we need to secure funding in a way that does not add extra effort to what we are already doing.

This proposal is about forming and maintain a pool of funds (a treasury) that is managed by the Eastern Townhall Trusted Seed. A pool of funds to spend at our discretion. The treasury will be used to cover expenses, to grow and sustain the efforts of the Eastern Townhall. Expenses like translation bounties; production of content; paying for online service subscriptions such as Zoom, Github, HackMD, Statbot and others; paying for activities related to organising the Eastern Town Hall.

Simply put this proposal is about funds for organising a community group. Establishing a resource and distributed support structure that provides funds needed on demand without the overhead of specific Catalyst proposals. 

In return, we promise to report back financial statements on our activities and expenses. Translated into as many languages as we can find collaborators for. Our intent is to pioneer and prototype DAO treasury management[3] reporting. That is not a small matter and managing a shared pool of funds has plenty of compliance complications. The reporting effort is Similar in principal to the work being done by index.coop[4] and FWB[5]. Most DAOs are still figuring this out and the best practices are not even drafts, so help us work this out. 

Learning how the Eastern Town Hall is spending and allocating funds will help us attract future funding. Help collaborators identify opportunities to work with us. 

Help us scale and reach more people across the Eastern Hemisphere.

### KPI measurement method and goals

A questionnaire on the number of proposers / voters / advisors was conducted for each FUND in the community of the target area. The goal is to grow 20% for each FUND in the next 6 months.

### Activities to reach KPIs

Daily: Inquiries from the community about Catalyst are answered by our members in their respective languages. We also manage financial matters. Eventually, multisig will allow you to manage your finances in a decentralized manner.

Weekly: We hold weekly management meetups, planning events and meetups, and sharing information that we want to share with each community. In addition, the progress of each project will be grasped and reported.

By FUND: Surveys will be conducted in each eastern community to count the number of voters, proposers and experts in each region.

### Details and costs to implement

1. Incentives for management meetings to create projects and events that activate Eastern Hemisphere activities every week: 20 people x 2 hours x 4 weeks x 6 months x $15 = $14,400

2. Incentives for financial management, progress management, monitoring and reporting activities, other new member recruiting activities, etc .: $ 500 x 6 months = $ 3,000

3. Common expenses: Expenses incurred across multiple projects (domain, server, Zoom…): $1,000

Total: (1) ＋ (2) ＋ (3): $18,400

▲ Discount: $8,400

Billed: $10,000

* The funds directly required for each activity, such as East Asian entrepreneurial events in the Eastern Hemisphere, meetups, translation activities, theme setting and management, etc., are not in the category of funds required for this proposal.

We have already started this activity and will continue to do so whether or not this funding is raised.We gave a 45.6% discount to free up funds for a wider project.

### Intellectual property right

Follow the policies set by each project, but we respect open source.

### After 6 months
  We will consider further funding requirements to maintain KPIs that support Cataslyt's success, including in the eastern region.
