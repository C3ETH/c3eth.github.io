## Challenge Brief

Currently if a DAO (even one that is aimed to build products and services around Cardano) wants to setup their DAO infrastructure, the current options are all based on, mostly, the Ethereum blockchain.

These dApps range from basic Treasury management, to Decision making in DAOs and even supporting services like Decentralized Justice. Some of them are:

- https://aragon.org
- https://daostack.io
- https://colony.io
- https://www.molochdao.com
- https://abridged.io
- https://kleros.io

### Cardano needs:

- Similar tools that offer superior features to those offered on other chains.
- Effective Collaboration Management Platforms to Organize Community Intentions and Actions
- Additional not yet existing tools to give Cardano a distinct advantage
- Tools for prospective organizations to use in evaluating the features available in Cardano DAO's:

  - DAO community collaboration
  - DAO creation
  - DAO operation
  - DAO governance.

## Why is it Important?

Blockchain applications have moved from Currency to DeFi, to NFT. DAOs are Next.  Cardano needs to be ready for when that happens.

## How does success look like?

There are no better ways to manage your DAO than to use Cardano DAOs. From Small Business to Global Communities.. Cardano DAOs deliver.

## Key Metrics to measure

- Number of Communities engaged in collaboration using Cardano DAO creation tools.
- Amount of ADA coming from DAOs transaction fees after the solutions on this challenge get implemented (> than the challenge's allocated fund amount)
- Number of DAOs that use Cardano as governance/management chain in 6 months.
- Number of DAO toolset/frameworks available for DAO Ops (>1).
