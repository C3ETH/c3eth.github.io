## Penjelasan Tantangan

Community Advisors (CAs) and Veteran Community Advisors (vCAs) are key players of the current Project Catalyst governance process. They assess proposals and by doing that, provide feedback to proposers to improve their ideas for the next fund, and support voter on deciding which proposals are more ready and have higher chances of being successful and impact the Cardano ecosystem.
