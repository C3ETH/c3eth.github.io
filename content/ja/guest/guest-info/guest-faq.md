### :round_pushpin: Do I need to register to host a Breakout room?

### :round_pushpin: How do we accept your Breakout room register?

You need to fill in the form provided and allow us at least 1 week for ETH Core Team members to validate provided info and once the consensus result of being accepted/rejected from the ETH team, you will be notified of the outcome.

### :round_pushpin: Can I request a Breakout room and present in my own language and audience?

Yes, as long as the content is suitable and impactful, and the participant understands.

### :round_pushpin: Is Breakout room hosting events the same as IdeaFest Reel activities where you can promote your proposals before or during the voting period?

No, all presentations and activities related to IdeaFest Reel will be not present in the breakout hosting sign-up.

### :round_pushpin: Why does consensus need for each Breakout room hosting in ETH?

Due to the nature of mainly non-English audiences, it is required for us to do due diligence on content, intention, purpose, presentation language use in a breakout room, etc. Thus, maximising hosting’s impacts and outcomes would be a benefit for both the participants and presenters.

### :round_pushpin: Can one group occupy and present for multiple and consecutive weeks in a breakout room?

Breakout room is a communication platform for all community members who wish to bring and share their ideas in English or their own languages, therefore, time and chance will divide equally among all members and the community.

### :round_pushpin: When accepted for hosting in the ETH Breakout room. Where will the presenter's information be displaced?

Your collected info will appear at <https://easterntownhall.com/guests> This info is there to stay. Your Breakout room recording video link will be shared with us and accessible from the ETH website. Subject to your recording quality, the content meets ETH and Cardano common values and does not bring the negative perception to Cardano proposers, builders and other communities’ members.
