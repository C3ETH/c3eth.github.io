We use [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) to format and generate the [c3eth website](https://c3eth.github.io/) and the [Doks](https://getdoks.org/) theme for styling and site structure.

Doks is a Hugo theme for building secure, fast, and SEO-ready documentation websites, which you can easily update and customize.

All submissions, including submissions by project members, require review. We use GitHub pull requests for this purpose. Consult [GitHub Help](https://help.github.com/articles/about-pull-requests/) for more information on using pull requests.

## Updating a single page

If you've just spotted something you'd like to change while using the docs, Doks has a shortcut for you:

1. Click **Edit this page on Github** at the end of the page.
1. If you don't already have an up to date fork of the project repo, you are prompted to get one - click **Fork this repository and propose changes** or **Update your Fork** to get an up to date version of the project to edit. The appropriate page in your fork is displayed in edit mode.

## Creating an issue

If you've found a problem in the c3eth documenation, but you're not sure how to fix it yourself, please create an issue in the [c3eth repo](https://github.com/c3eth/c3eth.github.io/issues).
