## Campaign Brief

Dapp proposals should cover foundational Registry solutions, namely:

National ID & Civil Registry, Property Registration, Medical & Vaccination, Education Census, Revenue Service, Business Incorporations, Elections Voting, Customs & Border Control, Criminal Records, Employment Census, Vehicle Registration, Licensing & Certifications.

Proposers to review IOHK/ EMURGO Atala solutions before hand along with reference use cases on integrated registry systems applications currently implemented across wealthy nations.

It is further advised Proposers to obtain a knowledge base over research done in the past three decades unraveling the "mysterious" causes of poverty in third world countries by the economist Hernando de Soto. The attached book "The Mystery of Capital" is a great reference to get into context for anyone involved in developing proposals for this challenge.
