Fund Size: **$75,000 USD paid in Ada**

[Campaign page](https://cardano.ideascale.com/a/campaign-home/26106) and [browse ideas](https://cardano.ideascale.com/a/ideas/top/campaign-filter/byids/campaigns/26106/stage/unspecified).

## Campaign Brief

The growth of Cardano depends on meaningful participation from proposers, advisors, and voters.

## How success looks like

There's a strong funnel to motivate, inform and direct new participants towards providing a contribution that improves Catalyst's ROI.

## Key metric to measure

To assess ROI of this challenge we will ask ourselves:

Did we manage to increase meaningful participation from proposers, advisors, and voters?

Out of total number of new participants:

What % active community advisers?

What % watch townhalls?

What % vote?

What % proposes?

What % becomes a referrer?

## Guiding questions

- How can we increase meaningful participation from proposers, advisors, and voters?
- How do new people learn about Catalyst?
- How can we provide a central source of constantly updated information in different formats(text, video, p2p)?

## Potential directions

- Education and onboarding through timely YouTube content
- Better user experience through hardware wallet support, Daedalus/yoroi support ect.
- Reddit presence offering reliable information.
- Mentoring programs matching veteran Catalysts and new Catalysts.
