ðŸ‘‰  Why is it important?

Growing a marketplace & ecosystem of experts able to work on complex software is important to build and maintain the foundations of Cardano.

ðŸ‘‰  Challenge brief
Since Fund 6, the OSDE challenge aims to provide a stream of resources to teams that want to develop their projects and contribute back to the community by sharing part of their efforts in terms of open source projects, open-source frameworks, and accessible knowledge.

ðŸ‘‰  Core Idea

The projects funded by Catalyst should be able to generate business value retained by the teams, and at the same time contribute back to the Cardano community.
