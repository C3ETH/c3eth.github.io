## Catalyst TV - Enable any Webapps to use PRISM

A browser wallet is crucial for gaining massive adoption of Atala PRISM. We saw this when MetaMask was released. Since then, it unlocked the Ethereum ecosystem to any developer. I expect that this PRISM browser wallet does the same for Atala PRISM.

Stop by to give kudo and a vote for this wonderful project which builds a Browser Extension (like MetaMask) that will allow people to manage their identities/credentials and allow web apps to easily interact with PRISM.
