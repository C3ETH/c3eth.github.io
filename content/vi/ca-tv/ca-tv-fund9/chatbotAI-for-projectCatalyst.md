## Catalyst TV - Chatbot AI for Project Catalyst

- [Ideascale](https://cardano.ideascale.com/c/idea/421602)
- **Requested Budget:** 40124

The information involved in Project Catalyst is continuously updated and disseminated through many different channels and media, making it hard for users to find the neat info when needed.
The solution is to build an AI chatbot that could promptly answer most of the Project Catalyst-related questions when users ask.

Examples:

- "How many DAO proposals are there?"
- "When are proposal drafts due?"
