## Catalyst TV - CatalystTalk: Grow Vietnamese Devs

- [Ideascale](https://cardano.ideascale.com/c/idea/419863)
- **Challenge:** Grow East Asia, Grow Cardano
- **Requested Budget:** 15000

🌟 Vietnam has a team of potential developers and lots of ideas. However, many ideas remain unrealized due to a lack of funds to implement and a lack of accessibility and understanding of Catalyst. The team will organize talks about Catalyst for developers in Vietnam, with the participation of Coreteams and proposers.
