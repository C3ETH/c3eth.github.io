We use [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) to format and generate the [c3eth website](https://c3eth.github.io/) and the [Docsy](https://github.com/google/docsy) theme for styling and site structure. 

Hugo is an open-source static site generator that provides us with templates, content organisation in a standard directory structure, and a website generation engine. You write the pages in Markdown (or HTML if you want), and Hugo wraps them up into a website.

All submissions, including submissions by project members, require review. We use GitHub pull requests for this purpose. Consult [GitHub Help](https://help.github.com/articles/about-pull-requests/) for more information on using pull requests.

## Updating a single page

If you've just spotted something you'd like to change while using the docs, Docsy has a shortcut for you:

1. Click **Edit this page** in the top right hand corner of the page.
1. If you don't already have an up to date fork of the project repo, you are prompted to get one - click **Fork this repository and propose changes** or **Update your Fork** to get an up to date version of the project to edit. The appropriate page in your fork is displayed in edit mode.

## Creating an issue

If you've found a problem in the c3eth documenation, but you're not sure how to fix it yourself, please create an issue in the [c3eth repo](https://github.com/c3eth/c3eth.github.io/issues). You can also create an issue about a specific page by clicking the **Create Issue** button in the top right hand corner of the page.
