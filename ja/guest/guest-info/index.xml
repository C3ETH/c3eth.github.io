Purposes # A bi-weekly Eastern Town Hall (ETH) meetup is a place for Eastern Hemisphere communities to update, share ideas, present projects, invite the community into meaningful discussions, and find like-minded people to collaborate and build projects together on the Cardano blockchain.
Hosting a Breakout room for your own community, and events to support Project Catalyst goals, we wish to provide a safe and lively environment to explore the highest potential of human collaboration as well as to onboard, introduce and educate community members to our ecosystem.</description></item><item><title>Sign-up form</title><link>/ja/guest/guest-info/guest-signup/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/ja/guest/guest-info/guest-signup/</guid><description>Sign-up through the following link: Breakout room registration Sign up to the form above.
