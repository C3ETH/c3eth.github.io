This repository contains Cardano Catalyst Community (C3) Eastern Townhall (ETH) updates and related documentation. C3ETH is helping to enable community members from a wide variety of countries and languages in the eastern timezones. A particular focus of the team is to localise Cardano Catalyst content and on-boarding to enable the widest participation possible.

This repository contains C3ETH translations of Project Catalyst documentation, community-sourced documentation, and related proposals. The content is translated into the many languages of the eastern hemisphere, with a particular focus on East Asian languages.

[Project Catalyst](https://cardano.ideascale.com/) is the **beginning** of bringing on-chain governance to Cardano. It is a series of experiments that leverage the collective intelligence of the Catalyst Community to determine the future direction and development of the Cardano ecosystem. Through a series of innovation funds, the community sources ideas decides which to fund, and finances them. Sourcing the best ideas for building a global blockchain.

## Building with Docker

The website and documentation is compiled and developed using [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) and the [Docsy Theme](https://www.docsy.dev/). To build the site requires [Node](https://nodejs.org/en/), [Npm](https://www.npmjs.com/), and [PostCSS](https://postcss.org/). Instead of having to locally install these tools, you can build the site using [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-started/overview/). This has the advantage of providing a uniform development environment.

- Docker: To install docker, please refer to the documentation at [https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/).

- Once you've made your working copy (see below) of the site repo, from the repo root folder, running the hugo serve container with docker:

  ```
  $ docker-compose up -d
  ```

Then visit http://localhost:1313 to view the documentation site

## Building with a local development environment 

The Website is built using [Docsy](https://www.docsy.dev/) which is a [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) theme for technical documentation sets, providing simple navigation, site structure, and more.

### Prerequisites

Building and running the site locally requires a recent `extended` version of [Hugo](https://gohugo.io). The following are basic prerequisites building this site:

- Install a recent release of the Hugo "extended" version (we recommend version 0.53 or later). If you install from the 
  [release page](https://github.com/gohugoio/hugo/releases), make sure you download the `_extended` version 
  which supports SCSS.

- Install `PostCSS` so that the site build can create the final CSS assets. You can install it locally by running 
  the following commands from the root directory of your project:

  ```
  sudo npm install -D --save autoprefixer
  sudo npm install -D --save postcss-cli
  ```

- Once you've made your working copy (see below) of the site repo, from the repo root folder, run:

  ```
  hugo server
  ```

## Cloning the Website

```bash
$ git clone --recurse-submodules --depth 1 https://github.com/C3ETH/c3eth.github.io.git
$ cd c3eth.github.io
```

The site is build on the [Docsy theme](https://www.docsy.dev/) as a submodule. To update the submodule run:

```bash
$ git submodule update --recursive
$ git pull --recurse-submodules
```
## Edit Website Documents
