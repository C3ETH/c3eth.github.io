Challenge question: # How do we grow the Cardano ecosystem in East Asia in an inclusive and supportive way? The same way we do in Africa, focused initiatives!
Why is it important? # The Cardano community leans heavily toward North America and Europe. Growth elsewhere requires our support and initiative as a community.
How does success look like? # A broad spectrum of people across Asia and connected to Asia, coming together and forming teams to grow our ecosystem.</description></item><item><title>Grow Social &amp; Environmental Finance</title><link>/catalyst/fund6/challenge-setting-proposals/grow-social-finance/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/catalyst/fund6/challenge-setting-proposals/grow-social-finance/</guid><description>Requested Amount (USD): $250,000
