This paper presents Universal Anonymous Signatures (UAS).
We are really excited about it as, besides bridging several subfields in the domain of anonymous authentication, UAS sets the path towards what we believe could be (part of) the future of Self-Sovereign Identity and something we will definitely push for integration within the Atala offering.</description></item></channel></rss>
