Translations can be done by anyone in the community; Language moderators need to approve the changes and submit the pull requests.

Please refer to the [Contributors Guide](/README/en/CONTRIBUTING.md) to understand what it means to contribute.

**Language moderators (assignees)**: Please check off the language(s) above when you have approved the translations and a pull request has been submitted. That way others know it has been done. 

### Merging Translations

When the document has been translated, the Pull Request will be checked, and any fixes applied. The pull request is then merged and published when the website is next released.

**Site Maintainers/Admins:** Check the pull requests and merge the files. Please check off the languages merged above so we know what is left to do.

Also link the PR with this issue and remove the associated language(s) label(s) covered by the PR. That makes it easier to find any active translations tasks by language.

*NOTE*: Fixes are typically required because the translation software (GitLocalize) incorrectly escapes special characters used in Hugo markdown files.
